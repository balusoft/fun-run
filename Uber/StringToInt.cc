Total Accepted: 93125 Total Submissions: 694591 Difficulty: Easy
Implement atoi to convert a string to an integer.

Hint: Carefully consider all possible input cases. If you want a challenge,
please do not see below and ask yourself what are the possible input cases.

Notes: It is intended for this problem to be specified vaguely (ie, no given
input specs). You are responsible to gather all the input requirements up front.

Update (2015-02-10):
The signature of the C++ function had been updated. If you still see your
function signature accepts a const char * argument, please click the reload
button  to reset your code definition.
