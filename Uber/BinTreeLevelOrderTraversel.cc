Total Accepted: 95255 Total Submissions: 295621 Difficulty: Easy
Given a binary tree, return the level order traversal of its nodes' values. (ie,
from left to right, level by level).

For example:
Given binary tree {3,9,20,#,#,15,7},
    3
       / \
         9  20
             /  \
                15   7
                return its level order traversal as:
                [
                  [3],
                    [9,20],
                      [15,7]
                      ]
                      confused what "{1,#,2,3}" means? > read more on how binary
tree is serialized on OJ.
