This contains source code for KdTree build_kdtree, query_kdtree applications and its library APIs

Source Tree:
------------
Here is the source code tree structure
ROOT
|
|- lib
|  - KDTree.hpp => Contains APIs for insert, find nearest neighbor APIs
|
|- build_kdtree
|  - Contains source code for build_kdtree application
|
|- query_kdtree
|  - Contains source code for query kdtree application
|
|- gen
|  - Make generated directory contains generated files like Unit Test files.
|
|- bin
|  - build_kdtree --> this application generated KD tree for given data points(CSV).
|                     Takes additional input as path of tree file.
|
|  - query_kdtree --> this application searches provided Points from points CSV file
|                     And generates the output as [nearest-point],distance. Takes
|                     Additional input as <treePathName> and <resultFilePath> to store
|                     results.
|
|  - test_XXX     --> Various Unit Test binaries which generated during build process to
|                     test libraries and applications

Additional resources used:
--------------------------

1) CxxTest, for unit test purpose, source code is already added in GoogleDrive to make build work.
   For more details refer here: http://cxxtest.com/


Quality:
--------
1) All code is Unit Tested by using CxxTest automation
2) All unit tests are ran against valgrind to find memory errors.

How to Build:
-------------
From current directory simply run 'make' or 'make -f Makefile'
