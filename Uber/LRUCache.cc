146. LRU Cache My Submissions Question
Total Accepted: 66895 Total Submissions: 425395 Difficulty: Hard
Design and implement a data structure for Least Recently Used (LRU) cache. It
should support the following operations: get and set.

get(key) - Get the value (will always be positive) of the key if the key exists
in the cache, otherwise return -1.
set(key, value) - Set or insert the value if the key is not already present.
When the cache reached its capacity, it should invalidate the least recently
used item before inserting a new item.
