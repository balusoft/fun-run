Given a set of distinct integers, nums, return all possible subsets.

Note:
Elements in a subset must be in non-descending order.
The solution set must not contain duplicate subsets.
For example,
If nums = [1,2,3], a solution is:

[
  [3],
    [1],
      [2],
        [1,2,3],
          [1,3],
            [2,3],
              [1,2],
                []
                ]
